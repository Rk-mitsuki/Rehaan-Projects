Here, the code is very scattered. The core algorithm is in the ReducedOrderModel-Numerical file and is saved as a .pkl file. This is then taken to the predict.py file to develop the web app. 

The same core algorithm is also used in the ReducedOrderModel-Contour file which contains the code for the Visual ROM and a lot of testing I had to do beforehand. The areas for inputs are given as variables in this file.

The code for the other neural networks tested out are included in the neuralnetworks file and the code for the LatinHypercube Sampling is also given.
